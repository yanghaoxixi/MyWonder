## Project Summary

- **What: MyWonder** is a new platform for big data analytics and visualization provided by Khider&Garijo CORP.
- **Why:** Data visualization is time consuming. Users need to spend for hours for waiting. This platform can reduce it to less than 10min.
- **How:** Distribute massive files on the cloud to improve the efficiency.
- **Why good:** User can calculate analytics and summaries from their phones easily, even before jumping to a meeting.

### Identified wastes

- **Waiting** CEO needs to call customer assistance team to meet with clients. And customer support need to talk to designer and then met with developers, then finally update contents by backend team.
- **Skills** The terminology and contents used in UI is not very appropriate for demos. And there is no area to put a "Note" in visualizations.
- **Over-Processing** Team work separately and create too many examples of visualization to be used for demos.
